<!--
Internal status-tracker for tooling bugs we may file upstream. Keep the
rich format here; generate a slim external paste doc from this body using
the template at docs/diagnostics/spec-kitty-bug-report-external-template.md
when ready to file upstream.

See docs/runbooks/spec-kitty-bug-reporting.md for the full workflow.
