# Physical Topology

Authoritative data: [`data/hardware-inventory.json`](<./data/hardware-inventory.json>), [`data/network-topology.json`](<./data/network-topology.json>)

## Hosts

### office2 — Always-On Hub

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Hardware | Dell XPS 8700 |
| CPU | Intel Core i7-4790 @ 3.60GHz |
| RAM | 32 GB |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB (Pascal GP106, compute 6.1) — driver 535.288.01, CUDA 12.2 |
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (kernel 6.8.0-111-generic) |
| Local IP | 192.168.1.158 |
| Tailscale IP | 100.92.197.90 |
| Role | Always-on hub — runs all services |

**Storage:**

| Mount | Device | Size | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| `/` | LVM (SSD) | 98 GB | OS and home directories |
| `/data` | `/dev/sda1` (HDD) | 2.7 TB | Services, transcripts, application data |
| `/mnt/backups` | `/dev/sdg1` | 916 GB | Restic backup repository |

**BIOS / firmware:**

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| BIOS version | A13 (2018-06-13) | Final firmware Dell shipped for the XPS 8700; no further updates expected |
| AC power restoration | Power on | Auto-recovers after power outages — important for "always-on hub" role (set 2026-05-08 after a Detroit outage took the server offline for two days) |
| Primary display | PCIe / discrete GPU | GTX 1060 drives the console |
| Secure boot | Enabled | Canonical-signed nvidia driver works without MOK enrollment |
| Console resolution | 800x600 (firmware ceiling) | UEFI hands the kernel a low-res framebuffer at POST and it cannot be overridden in OS — see issue #191 |

### office4 — Development Machine

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Hardware | Framework Desktop (AMD Ryzen AI Max 300 Series) |
| OS | Linux Mint 22.3 (Ubuntu 24.04 noble base) |
| Tailscale IP | 100.112.83.28 |
| Role | Kent's primary development machine — **attended**, unmanaged peer |

office4 is always-on, but that is **not** what makes office2 the hub. The axis is
attendedness: office2 runs unwatched, office4 runs where Kent is working. office4 is
therefore **not a managed host** — it runs no registered service, is not a felix-deployer
target, and has no `claude` or `codex` Unix user. See
[ADR-0008](<./adr/0008-three-machine-model.md>) for the decision, the placement test for
new workloads, and the constraints that follow.

### MacBook Pro — Authoring Endpoint

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Tailscale IP | 100.71.19.66 |
| Role | Authoring, interaction, SSH to office2 |

### iPhone 14 Pro Max — Mobile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Tailscale IP | 100.109.208.6 |
| Role | Mobile capture (Wispr Flow), task monitoring (Vikunja web UI), emergency SSH access via Termius |
| SSH client | Termius mobile (free plan), two host entries: `kgale` and `claude` users, both via Tailscale → office2 sshd. See [phone-termius-setup runbook](<../../runbooks/phone-termius-setup.md>) |

## Network

All inter-device communication uses **Tailscale**. **No service is exposed to the public
internet** — effective when deploy manifest 0030 and its operator script apply: the one
exception, the spec-kitty-qa `qa-dispatch-webhook` behind Tailscale Funnel on `:8443`
(live 2026-08-04..2026-09-08, #886), was retired by mission
`qa-pipeline-decommission-01M219TT` (#970), which turns the Funnel off. Every service is
tailnet-only. No port forwarding or NAT traversal outside Tailscale. (This paragraph
asserted no public exposure until 2026-08-22 — corrected per #886 while the Funnel was
live — and returned to zero public exposure per #970.)

**Tailscale Serve**: Port 443 on the `tailscale0` interface proxies to `100.92.197.90:3456` (Vikunja). TLS is terminated by Tailscale with auto-provisioned Let's Encrypt certificates. Access to
this `:443` Serve is tailnet-only. (A separate Funnel on `:8443` →
`127.0.0.1:3457` was public-internet reachable 2026-08-04..2026-09-08 for the
`qa-dispatch-webhook`; retired by #970 — the operator script turns it off, leaving
this `:443` Serve as the only Tailscale-fronted listener.)

**SSH access:**
- Agents: `ssh office2-claude` (claude user, no sudo)
- Kent (Mac): `ssh office2-kgale` (kgale user, sudo available)
- Kent (phone, Termius): two host entries, both via Tailscale → office2 sshd — `kgale` for general ops + `claude` for `gog-reauth` and other claude-user tasks. Termius SSH ID public key is in both users' `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Setup procedure: [phone-termius-setup runbook](<../../runbooks/phone-termius-setup.md>).
- Host aliases defined in `~/.ssh/config` on Mac
- **Tailscale SSH is enabled on office2** (`tailscale up --ssh`; confirmed via `tailscale debug prefs` showing `RunSSH: true`). tailscaled intercepts incoming SSH on port 22 of the Tailscale IP (100.92.197.90), applies the tailnet ACL, then passes through to sshd. Current ACL: `action: "accept"` for `autogroup:member` → `autogroup:self` → `autogroup:nonroot, root`. The change from `check` to `accept` is documented in [ADR-0004](<./adr/0004-tailscale-ssh-with-accept-acl.md>). **This is office2-only** — office4 has Tailscale SSH off (`tailscale debug prefs` → `"RunSSH": false`), so tailscaled does not intercept port 22 there and the accept-passthrough has nothing to act on. office4's own sshd is still reachable over the tailnet, just without the ACL layer in front of it.

## Service Dependencies

See [Service Dependencies Diagram](<./service-dependencies.view.md>) for a visual map of how services on office2 depend on each other. This diagram is derived from the `dependencies` field in `data/service-inventory.json` and is used during change control pre-flight assessment to determine blast radius.
