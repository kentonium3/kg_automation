"""Check that relative links in repo-owned markdown actually resolve.

Why this exists (#927, #944)
----------------------------
Two batches of broken links were found by one-off manual sweeps during unrelated
missions, months apart. Eleven of the fourteen in the second batch were the *same*
mistake: a relative path one or two directory levels too shallow — the depth from
``docs/design/architecture/`` back to ``docs/runbooks/`` is easy to get wrong, and
the error is invisible on GitHub's rendered view until somebody clicks it. Two of
them pointed at the change-control governance docs, which is exactly what a reader
following a Tier-1/Tier-2 procedure would click.

Nothing checked links, so the class recurred silently. This closes that.

Two parsing details that are NOT optional
-----------------------------------------
A naive checker produces ~73% false positives on this repo. Both causes are
addressed here, and removing either will bring the noise back:

1. **Code must be stripped first.** ``docs/runbooks/doc-maintenance.md`` is a
   document *about writing documentation*, so it legitimately contains
   ``[text](path)`` and ``./bar.md`` as teaching examples. Counting those as
   broken links is a measurement artifact, not a finding.

2. **Both link forms must be handled.** This repo widely uses the angle-bracket
   form ``[text](<path>)`` alongside plain ``[text](path)``. A pattern that only
   handles the plain form captures a bare ``<`` as the target and reports every
   angle-bracket link as broken.

What is deliberately NOT checked
--------------------------------
* ``docs/archive/`` — frozen historical artifacts; their links describe the world
  as it was, and "fixing" them would falsify the record.
* ``kitty-specs/`` — spec-kitty-owned mission artifacts, not repo documentation.
* ``**/skills/**`` — vendored spec-kitty skill files reference spec-kitty's *own*
  docs (``docs/api/bulk-edit-gate.md`` and similar), which do not exist in a
  consumer repo and never will. They are installed artifacts, not our prose.
* ``.agents/autonomous-run-guard/`` — a payload received wholesale from
  ``spec-kitty-qa`` (#964), where its docs sat beside siblings that are not here.
  Same shape as the skills case: the links describe that repo's tree, not ours.
  Editing them is not an option — the intake asserts every file byte-identical to
  ``spec-kitty-qa@main`` by sha256, and this is the only surviving copy, so
  "fixing" a link would falsify the record it exists to be.
* URLs, anchors, and ``mailto:``/``tel:`` — this checks the filesystem, not the
  network, so it stays fast and offline.

def repo_markdown_files(root: Path) -> list[Path]:

    `git ls-files --cached` -- the index -- rather than a tree walk, because the
    walk had to be told what to ignore by a hand-maintained name list, and that
    list drifted: it named neither `.codex-tmp-home/` (39 findings) nor
    `.kittify/` (13), so a scan on a developer machine reported 52 broken links
    that CI could not see. The question "is this repo content?" already has an
    authoritative answer in .gitignore; asking git removes the second, drifting
    copy of it.

    Deliberately NOT `--others --exclude-standard`. `--exclude-standard` also
    consults `.git/info/exclude` and the user's global `core.excludesFile` --
    per-clone state that is never committed (this clone has 11 such entries) --
    so including untracked files would reintroduce the per-machine variance this
    function exists to remove. That reason stands on its own; an earlier draft
    also cited "measured, --others adds zero files", which was measured on a
    clean tree and so could not have come out any other way.

    The trade this makes, stated because nothing else names it: the gate now
    checks the INDEX, so a markdown file written but not yet `git add`-ed is not
    scanned. A broken link in a brand-new doc surfaces once it is staged rather
    than the moment it is saved.

    Raises RuntimeError if git cannot answer. It must not fall back to walking --
    that silently restores the 52 phantom findings -- and must not return [],
    which would make the caller unable to tell "no broken links" from "could not
    enumerate".
