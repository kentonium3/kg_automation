# kg-automation — Claude Code Context

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at session start.
Read this first. Read nothing else until this is complete.

## Issue-First Habit

When the user asks for a bug fix, feature, investigation, or any change
that touches deployed services, agent config, or multiple files — ask
*"Want me to create an issue for this first?"* before starting work.
This applies during casual conversation, not just during planned
workflow execution. The issue takes 30 seconds and gives us audit
trail, doc-audit triggers, and cross-session context. Exempt: typo
fixes, single-line doc edits, CLAUDE.md updates, and pure research
questions.

## What This System Is

kg-automation is Kent Gale's personal AI operating system — an always-on
accountability and automation infrastructure built on office2 (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS,
Tailscale-accessible) with OpenClaw as the orchestration engine and Vikunja as
the task store and UI layer.

This is not a general-purpose automation repo. It is a personal system with a
specific architecture. Read `docs/design/felix-capability-roadmap.md` for design
intent, capability status, and open decisions. The GitHub issue queue is the
authoritative work backlog.

## Platform

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| MacBook Pro | Primary authoring and interaction |
| office4 (Linux Mint 22.3) | Kent's primary development machine — **attended, unmanaged peer**; not a deploy target |
| office2 (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) | Always-on hub — OpenClaw, Vikunja, inbox processor. The **only managed host** |
| iPhone | Mobile capture (Wispr Flow) and task monitoring (Vikunja web UI) |
| GitHub | Version control, CI validation on push |
| Obsidian Sync | Vault sync across Mac, iPhone, and office2 (**not** office4 — no vault there) |

**Which machine does what.** office2 is unattended; office4 is attended. Both are always-on,
so uptime is not the distinguishing axis — attendedness is. Before placing any workload, read
[ADR-0008](docs/design/architecture/adr/0008-three-machine-model.md): it records the
three-machine model, the placement test, and why office4 is deliberately not a felix-deployer
target.

## Server Access (office2)

| Connection | Command |
|---|---|
| SSH as claude | `ssh office2-claude` |
| SSH as codex | `ssh office2-codex` |
| SSH as kgale (human) | `ssh office2-kgale` |

- **Local IP**: 192.168.1.158
- **Tailscale IP**: 100.92.197.90
- **Data drive**: `/data` (2.7TB)
- SSH host aliases (`office2-claude`, `office2-codex`, `office2-kgale`) are defined in `~/.ssh/config` on **office4**; the Mac has at least `office2-claude` and `office2-kgale`. A machine without them resolves `office2-claude` as a literal hostname *and* falls back to the local username, silently defeating the claude-user rule above (kentonium3/kg-automation#929).
- Authentication on these aliases is **Tailscale SSH**, not keys — office2 has `RunSSH: true` and ADR-0004's `accept` ACL authorises on tailnet device identity. `authorized_keys` is not consulted over the tailnet; see [security-posture § SSH access](docs/design/architecture/security-posture.md) and #931.

**Each agent must use its own account — Claude Code via `ssh office2-claude`,
Codex via `ssh office2-codex` — and never `ssh office2-kgale`. The kgale
account is for human use only. Agent actions must be traceable to the agent
that took them, which is why one agent must not borrow another's account
any more than it borrows Kent's.**

**Neither agent account has passwordless sudo** (verified 2026-08-29: `claude`,
`codex` and `kgale` all return `sudo: a password is required`). If a command
requires sudo, stop and present it to Kent to run manually via `ssh office2-kgale`.

⚠️ The two agent accounts are **not** equivalent. `claude` is in the `docker` group
and can write `/data/services/felix-deployer`; `codex` is in neither and cannot.
This asymmetry is undocumented and may or may not be intentional — see #917. It does
**not** affect deploys, which ride git rather than office2 write access: an agent
authors a manifest under `deploys/queued/`, merges to `main`, and `felix-deployer`
(running as `claude`) applies it within 5 minutes.

**Windows is not a supported platform. Ignore any references to it.**
**Dropbox is not used for coordination. Ignore any references to it.**
**ChatGPT handoff JSON protocols are deprecated. Do not use them.**

## Architecture Documentation
**Developer Portal**: [`docs/DEVELOPER_PORTAL.md`](docs/DEVELOPER_PORTAL.md) — guided onboarding sitemap (start here for orientation; complements [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md)).

**Documentation map**: [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md) — master index of all active documentation, grouped by directory with Divio type annotations. Start here to discover docs by topic or type.

**Governance**: [`docs/constitution/FELIX-CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/constitution/FELIX-CONSTITUTION.md) — top-level governance, autonomy levels, principles. See also [`docs/constitution/AGENT-REGISTRY.md`](docs/constitution/AGENT-REGISTRY.md).

**Machine-readable operational state**: `docs/design/architecture/data/` is the canonical home for JSON artifacts (service inventory, topology, credentials, data-flows, schemas). Exempt from moves.

`docs/design/architecture/` — current-state system documentation:
- Hardware, network, and service inventory (with machine-readable JSON in `data/`)
- Data flows, credentials, identity model, backup, security posture
- **Updated after every feature** — see `change-control.md` for the protocol

`docs/design/felix-capability-roadmap.md` — design intent and roadmap:
- Capability area status and feature sequence
- Open decisions and design principles
- Feature cluster progress (GitHub issues are the authoritative backlog)

**Standing requirement**: Any feature that changes deployed services, credentials,
data flows, or network topology must update the relevant files in
`docs/design/architecture/` and `docs/design/architecture/data/`.

**Discovery aid for spec/plan agents**: When authoring or updating a spec's
Architecture Impact section (during `/spec-kitty.specify` and `/spec-kitty.plan`),
consult `docs/design/architecture/data/signal-to-doc-map.json` for the canonical
list of affected docs per change class. Filter entries by
`match.source == "mission-architecture-impact"` and pick the `change_class`
values that fit the mission (e.g., `service-added-or-modified`,
`credential-added-or-modified`, `data-flow-added-or-modified`,
`network-topology-changed`, `runbook-added`, `runbook-modified`,
`architecture-doc-added`, `systemd-unit-added-or-modified`). Each entry's
`doc_targets` array enumerates the docs that must be reviewed and updated in
the mission's merge. Without this lookup, navigation docs like `docs/INDEX.md`
and `docs/DEVELOPER_PORTAL.md` are routinely missed — see #492 for the
precedent that motivated formalizing this. The map is the source of truth;
keep it current as new doc surfaces are added.

**Standing requirement**: Any work that deploys, modifies, or registers an
OpenClaw agent must read `docs/runbooks/openclaw-agent-setup.md` first.
That runbook defines the required workspace files (IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md,
AGENTS.md), the openclaw.json registration, and the verification steps.
An agent is not deployed until both the governance registry and OpenClaw
config are updated.

## Repository Structure

```
ai-agents/          ← agent instruction files (this file's siblings)
docs/
  archive/          ← pointer only; the artifacts moved to kg-auto-aux (#968)
  constitution/     ← governance — Felix constitution, agent registry
  design/           ← architecture specs, standards, research
  diagnostics/      ← active troubleshooting (spec-kitty workflow journal)
  runbooks/         ← operational runbooks (how-to guides)
scripts/            ← automation scripts
kitty-specs/        ← spec-kitty managed (DO NOT EDIT — see below)
.kittify/           ← spec-kitty managed (DO NOT EDIT — see below)
.github/
  ISSUE_TEMPLATE/   ← issue templates (feature, bug, rfc, infra, docs-debt)
```

**`kitty-specs/` and `.kittify/` are owned by spec-kitty.** These directories
contain mission specifications, work packages, status event logs, and workflow
configuration managed exclusively by spec-kitty commands. Agents and humans
must **never** directly create, edit, move, or delete files in these directories.
All changes flow through spec-kitty slash commands (`/spec-kitty.*`). Reading
these files for context is fine; writing to them is not.

## Feature Development Workflow

**Finding the next work item:**

Query the issue queue for the highest priority open feature in the active
milestone:

```bash
gh issue list --repo kentonium3/kg-automation \
  --label P1-feature \
  --state open \
  --limit 5 \
  --json number,title,body,labels,milestone
```

Select the highest priority open issue. Read the full issue body — it is
the spec. If multiple P1-feature issues exist, prefer the one assigned to
the active milestone.

**Spec readiness gate:**
Before entering the spec-kitty workflow, the issue MUST have the `spec: ready`
label. Issues follow a three-label lifecycle:

- `spec: brief` — default on new feature/infra issues. Low-friction capture.
- `spec: pending` — auto-added by GitHub Actions when a P1/P2 priority label
  is applied. Signals "needs body formalized before spec-kitty." Visible in
  project board for planning/sweep queries.
- `spec: ready` — manually applied after the issue body meets the structured
  template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` or `infra.md`). Clears the
  issue for `/spec-kitty.specify`.

Do not run `/spec-kitty.specify` on an issue without `spec: ready`.
To find issues needing formalization, query for `spec: pending`.

**Implementation sequence:**
1. Verify the issue has the `spec: ready` label
2. Read the issue body completely before starting anything else
3. Run spec-kitty specify using the issue body as input
4. Follow the full spec-kitty workflow:
   `/spec-kitty.specify → /spec-kitty.plan → /spec-kitty.tasks →
    /spec-kitty.implement → /spec-kitty.review → /spec-kitty.merge`
5. On merge, close the issue: `gh issue close <number> --repo kentonium3/kg-automation`
6. Add a comment to the issue with the merge commit hash and any relevant notes

**Auto-driving the workflow:**
When Kent says to "proceed through the workflow" or equivalent, drive the full
arc (specify → plan → tasks → implement → review → merge) without waiting for
him to type each slash command. In spec-kitty 3.2.0rc37+ the command files
split two ways:

*Prompt-driven runbooks (read fresh each step, follow instructions, honor
the "Startup Upgrade Check" block at the top):*
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.specify.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.plan.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.tasks.md` (plus `tasks-outline.md`,
  `tasks-packages.md`, `charter.md`, `analyze.md`, `research.md`)

*CLI-driven shims (~9 lines — just run the underlying CLI):*
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.implement.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.review.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.accept.md`
- `~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.merge.md`

For shims, run `spec-kitty <step> <args>` directly. The shim's literal
instruction is "Run this exact command and treat its output as authoritative.
Do not rediscover context." Don't improvise pre-work; the CLI owns the state
machine.

Sanity check after spec-kitty upgrades: `wc -l ~/.claude/commands/spec-kitty.<step>.md`
— <10 = shim, 100s = runbook.

**Only stop for:**
1. Mandatory stops marked in the command file (e.g., "MANDATORY STOP POINT")
2. Required input from Kent (discovery questions, scope decisions, approvals)
3. **ANY unexpected spec-kitty (or sibling-tooling) behavior — whether or not
   you could work around it.** Non-exhaustive triggers: missing or inconsistent
   state/status; **authority confusion** (which checkout/branch/actor owns a
   step — the coordination split-authority class); **source or location errors**
   (wrong path/file/checkout); **ambiguous direction that forces retries or
   redos** to get it right; **permissions issues**; **unexpected git conditions**
   (branch, worktree, index, stale state — e.g. a merge that lands but leaves the
   checkout needing manual git surgery); a command that fails/blocks/produces
   unexpected output; a gate that won't pass. STOP, capture the exact error +
   command sequence, and surface it. **Silently working around a resolvable
   anomaly is prohibited** — it destroys the evidence that is the only way
   spec-kitty gets better. Happy-path decisions *within* the prescribed path are
   fine (authoring spec/plan/tasks/matrix artifacts, committing workflow-generated
   status files) — those are NOT "unexpected."

Do not stop to ask "should I proceed to the next step?" — the instruction to
drive the workflow IS the approval for all subsequent steps until a genuine
stop condition is hit. This does NOT narrow rule 3: auto-drive removes per-step
approval, never the duty to stop and surface any unexpected workflow behavior.

**Codex review checkpoints (mandatory):** the arc includes two independent Codex
review-and-fix passes — a **post-plan** review (after `/spec-kitty.plan`, before
`/spec-kitty.tasks`) for gaps/opportunities, and a **post-merge** review of the
complete merged diff (after all WPs merge; for feature-branch missions, before
`feat → main`) for cross-WP issues per-WP reviews can't see. These are not optional.
Canonical description in the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` "Codex review checkpoints".

**Issue types and their workflows:**
- `P1-feature` / `P2-feature` → full spec-kitty workflow above
- `P1-bug` / `P2-bug` → spec-kitty software-dev mission, fix-focused
- `P1-infra` / `P2-infra` → check risk tier in issue body first; Tier 0 = generate only
- `P1-rfc` → discussion and decision recording; no implementation until converted to feature/infra issue

**Legacy specs:** historical specs F001–F020 lived in `docs/archive/func-spec/`
until 2026-09-07; they now live in the private [`kg-auto-aux`](https://github.com/kentonium3/kg-auto-aux)
repo under `archive/func-spec/` (#968). They are the archive record. Do not
recreate them here — new features live in the GitHub issue queue.

**Design-time discipline (per Constitution Directive 6):** during
spec-kitty specify and plan phases, identify deterministic vs stochastic
work. Route every step that's mechanically verifiable into a helper
script the agent invokes; reserve the agent's prompt for judgment,
classification, and interpretation. Helper scripts live in
`scripts/<domain>/` and are tested independently. Do NOT force-extract
when a one-line agent step is genuinely correct — the rule is to
*recognize the split*, not to mechanize everything.

## Autonomous Fix-Runs (felix-dev-autopilot)

When Kent wants a curated backlog worked down unattended — pick issue → scope →
implement → test → adversarial-review → PR → CI-gate → merge → deploy →
live-verify → next — the rules and guardrails are captured in the
**felix-dev-autopilot** agent (#777). Invoke it with `/felix-dev-autopilot` or by
spawning the `felix-dev-autopilot` subagent, giving it a `repo`, a `queue`
(ordered issues), and a `risk_posture` (deploy tolerance + stop condition).

The single source of truth is the canonical operating contract
[`.agents/autopilot/felix-dev-autopilot-contract.md`](.agents/autopilot/felix-dev-autopilot-contract.md);
kg-automation's concrete gate/deploy/verify mechanics are in
[`.agents/autopilot/adapters/kg-automation.md`](.agents/autopilot/adapters/kg-automation.md).
Edit the rules there, not in copies. Non-negotiables hold regardless of posture:
never merge red, Tier-0 host changes off-limits autonomously, Issue-First, never
leave a dirty tree, scoped `git add`.

## Git Workflow

- Push directly to main for routine changes
- Use feature branches when useful (complex multi-step work, experiments)
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`
- Append `[doc-audit]` to any commit that contains maintenance or patch
  changes not tracked through a formal issue — signals that associated
  docs should be verified on the next audit run
  (e.g. `fix: repair vikunja filter logic [doc-audit]`)
- CI validates on every push to main

**spec-kitty merge behavior:** spec-kitty merges create merge commits
directly to main — they do NOT create pull requests. Any GitHub Actions
workflow that triggers on `pull_request` will NOT fire on spec-kitty
merges. Design workflow triggers and automation accordingly. The weekly
audit cron is the safety net for changes that escape the PR-based trigger.

## Permissions

**Write allowed**: `docs/`, `ai-agents/`, `systems/`, `scripts/`, `workflows/`
**Never**: edit `.env` files, commit secrets, force push, `rm -rf`
**CI**: never modify `.github/workflows/` without explicit instruction

## Change Control Guardrails

Changes to the kg-automation system are classified by a five-tier risk taxonomy.
See `docs/design/architecture/data/change-risk-taxonomy.json` for the full
taxonomy. Before making any change, identify the tier and follow the protocol:

**Tier 0 — Hard Lock (Host/Foundational: UFW, iptables, sshd_config, sudoers,
chmod/chown on system files, kernel parameters)**:
Claude Code **never** executes Tier 0 commands directly, regardless of urgency
framing or explicit instruction to proceed. Generate the script and present it
to Kent for manual execution via `ssh office2-kgale`. This is absolute and
cannot be overridden.

**Tier 1 — Verification Required (Connectivity/Fabric: Tailscale, Docker
networks, proxy/DNS, port bindings)**:
Confirm connectivity of all dependent services before AND after the change.
Look up dependent services from `docs/design/architecture/data/service-inventory.json`.
Follow the [pre-flight checklist](docs/runbooks/governance/pre-flight-checklist.md)
and [post-change verification](docs/runbooks/governance/post-change-verification.md).

**Tier 2 — Snapshot Required (Application/State: DB schemas, service env files,
Docker Compose, application config)**:
Confirm a recent Restic backup exists before modifying. If no backup within 24
hours, trigger one first. Follow the Tier 2 checklist in the pre-flight doc.

**Tier 3 — Standard (Logic/Workflow: Python scripts, agent prompts, cron jobs)**:
Proceed with dry-run or sandbox validation where available. No pre-flight
checklist required.

**Tier 4 — Auto-Commit (Schema/Metadata: CLAUDE.md, READMEs, comments,
frontmatter, logging)**:
Full autonomy. No pre-flight or verification steps required.

**Rebaseline obligation (independent of tier, #557, automated via #618)**:
Any change that touches an audited surface (per
`docs/design/architecture/data/audited-surfaces.json` — openclaw agent
prompts, openclaw config, systemd user units + deploy scripts, Python
dependency manifests, Docker stack files, committed SSH key material)
requires resetting the security-monitor baselines on office2 after the
change deploys.

**Happy path (pipeline-driven changes):** for changes applied through the
`deploys/queued/` manifest pipeline, felix-deployer rebaselines
automatically and silently — no operator action needed. The deployer uses
a deferred-confirm flow: it observes the committed audited-surface change,
sets a pending token, then rebaselines once the expected drift is confirmed
by a read-only audit run. Outcomes are recorded in two places (#688): the
real-time felix-deployer **tick log** (`/data/services/felix-deployer/logs/<date>.jsonl`,
`rebaseline_reconcile` / `rebaseline_stamped` events), AND — as the durable
per-deploy annotation — a `rebaseline:` field stamped onto the **applied YAML
record** (`deploys/applied/<NNNN>-<name>.yaml`) after reconcile (`outcome` +
`at_utc` + details). The operator is NOT the load-bearing component on the
happy path.

The observe range is driven by a **persisted last-observed-head watermark**
(`rebaseline-observed-head.json` in `/data/services/felix-deployer/state/`),
so the deployer detects audited-surface changes **regardless of which actor
advanced the checkout HEAD** — including an out-of-band `git pull` that
fast-forwards the checkout before the deployer's own tick runs (closes #685).
One caveat: a deploy whose drift has **no repo-file signal** (e.g. a runtime
`openclaw cron rm` that drifts a baseline without changing any tracked file)
is not detected by the observe range; such a deploy must declare the
baselines it will drift via the `expected_baselines` field in its manifest
(see [deployment.md](docs/runbooks/deployment.md)) so the auto-rebaseline
still covers it.

**Out-of-band exception (manual reset still required):** changes made
directly on office2 — not through the manifest pipeline — are invisible
to felix-deployer. The daily security audit surfaces these as drift;
investigate and reset manually. ⚠️ This deletes every baseline, and some are the
only surviving copy of the host state they fingerprint — archive them first
(see `docs/runbooks/security-baseline-ops.md`):

```bash
ssh office2-claude 'rm /data/services/security-monitor/baselines/* && sg docker -c /data/services/security-monitor/scripts/audit.sh'
```

(Canonical procedure in `docs/runbooks/security-baseline-ops.md`.)

**Failure / unexpected-drift:** if the automatic rebaseline fails or if
observed drift extends beyond what the change is expected to affect,
felix-deployer emits one ntfy alert and leaves the applied code in place.
A human must investigate before clearing.

**Soft-reminder CI** (`.github/workflows/audited-surface-reminder.yml`)
annotates pushes/PRs that touch audited paths. For spec-kitty missions,
the merge commit must record `Rebaseline: completed at <ts>` (automated
or manual), or `Rebaseline: not required — <reason>`.

**Transition note:** this mission's own merge (#618) touches
`scripts/deploy/**` (an audited surface) and predates the automation
being live. Its merge is rebaselined **manually** — the last manual one
for a pipeline-driven change.

## Deploys to office2

Every deploy to office2 flows through the **manifest discipline** at
`deploys/queued/<name>.yaml` consumed by the `felix-deployer` applier on office2.
The shared library at `scripts/deploy/lib/` provides vetted primitives for cron
management (OpenClaw only — never system crontab), backup verification,
file-presence checks, and tier guard.

When planning any feature/infra issue that involves deploying to office2, your
plan MUST include a `deploys/queued/<name>.yaml` manifest entry. See
[`docs/runbooks/deploy/discipline.md`](docs/runbooks/deploy/discipline.md)
for the operational pattern and worked examples.

**Sandbox carve-out.** A **throwaway/isolated sandbox** — a short-lived spike
that runs on a dedicated network/volume under a resource ceiling with
non-colliding ports, touches no production state or credential, and is torn down
after use (teardown removing pulled images and scratch too) — does **not** need
a manifest. The carve-out is narrow and conjunctive: fail any one criterion and
it rides the manifest discipline like any production deploy. It is
self-certified (nothing machine-checks it), so it still gets a lightweight note
(network/volume/ports + resource ceiling + teardown command) in its issue/spike
record **before it runs**, for the audit trail. Full criteria:
[`discipline.md` § Exception: throwaway / isolated sandboxes](docs/runbooks/deploy/discipline.md#exception-throwaway--isolated-sandboxes).

The 7 pre-discipline deploy scripts named in #548 were archived on 2026-06-13 —
their missions had all merged and the scripts were one-shot wrappers. They went to
`docs/archive/scripts/deploy/`, and moved with the rest of the archive to the
private [`kg-auto-aux`](https://github.com/kentonium3/kg-auto-aux) repo on
2026-09-07 (#968).

`deploy-felix-deployer-bootstrap.sh` is the post-discipline canonical bootstrap,
recorded by the manifest pipeline as
`deploys/applied/0002-bootstrap-felix-deployer-v2.yaml`. ⚠ It is **not** the only
entry in `scripts/deploy/` — there are 30, including `lib/` (the shared deploy
primitives), `felix-deployer/` (the applier itself), and per-mission deploy and
migration scripts. This paragraph asserted otherwise until 2026-09-07; corrected
after the claim was measured (#965).

## Documentation Standards

Machine-readable files (JSON) are the authoritative record for all operational
data. Narrative markdown documents provide context and rationale. Diagrams
(Mermaid `.view.md` files) are the preferred format for communicating system
structure and relationships. When machine-readable and narrative conflict, the
machine-readable version wins.

See [Felix Constitution Directive 5](docs/constitution/FELIX-CONSTITUTION.md)
for the full documentation standards principle.

## Engineering Principles

Two governing documents sit between the Felix Constitution (broad governance)
and individual feature specs:

- [`docs/design/engineering-principles.md`](docs/design/engineering-principles.md) — the 15 ratified
  principles covering runtime state, deterministic work, integration boundaries,
  JSON validation, test discipline, privacy enforcement, active-surface hygiene,
  suspension as an operational state, observability per feature, guardrail
  preference, idempotency, producer/consumer decoupling, single-point-of-failure
  recovery, checks that distinguish verified-false from could-not-check, and
  never operating on `$HOME` without setting it explicitly. Read these before designing new features or scoping new
  infrastructure work.
- [`docs/design/helper-script-conventions.md`](docs/design/helper-script-conventions.md) — the
  approved three-tier model (helper / library / skill), invocation-surface
  decision test, CLI interface contract, stdout convention, atomic state
  mutation, idempotency, failure-mode handling, observability, testing
  discipline, deploy story, and migration discipline. Operational source of
  truth referenced from Felix Constitution Directive 6.

When a feature, infrastructure change, or bug fix touches deterministic
verification work, the helper/library/skill decision is part of spec-ready
criteria (per the issue templates).

## Architecture Documentation

The system maintains a live architecture documentation store at
`docs/design/architecture/`. JSON files are the authoritative record;
markdown files are narrative views.

**Standing directive**: Any implementation that deploys, modifies, or removes
a service, credential, port, or data flow MUST update the relevant files in
`docs/design/architecture/data/` and their markdown counterparts as part of
the same PR. This is not optional and not a separate task.

See `docs/design/architecture/change-control.md` for the full update protocol.

## Second Brain Boundary

The second brain lives at `~/second-brain/` (separate repo: kentonium3/second-brain).
This repo (kg-automation) contains the system that acts on the second brain.
Do not conflate them. Do not write to second-brain paths from kg-automation tasks
unless explicitly instructed.

Kent's private content now lives in a separate laptop/phone-only vault that
office2 never syncs, so it is physically absent from any surface an agent can
reach — protection rests on physical exclusion, not a folder-name guard.
